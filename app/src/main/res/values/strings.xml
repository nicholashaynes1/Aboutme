    <string name="gym_text">I started going to the gym about a year ago, mainly because my girlfriend at the time told me I would be so hot with muscles. Whether or not she was right I am glad I listened because now I am in better shape, and feel how a teenager should (invincible). I really only started getting kind of serious about it at the beginning of summer though; Meaning, that I started going for longer with real goals and going 6 days a week. Over all I am very proud of myself that I actually began enjoying it, I just feel in a better place with it all in all. plus I am getting super yolked.</string>
